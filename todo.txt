== VEHICLES ==
Vecicles with ICE/Electric engines for people and cargo.
Hovering drones.
When vehicle go near vegetation, vegetation moves.
== TECH ==
Radio towers for signal used by vehicles, drones and beacons.
Drone can be send and collect data, even transmit video in realtime.
For example broken vehicle or drone can broadcast until it's battery is dead.
Automated turrets with cable infrastructure.

IN PROGRESS
    * Do rain ambient sound and thunder.
        * Cleanup sdl mixer.
    Hero moves.
        Draw the hero.
            Draw framed circle with the @ symbol inside.
                * Disk bitmap.Circle bitmap. 
                    * No need to keep bitmap for the atlas after packing of all sprites?
                        * Since all assets (even the procedural) are created on a single event, we don't need to keep bitmaps?
                        * Try to implement support for 8bit texture.
                            * SDL opengl renderer/texture supports only 32bpp and 16bpp luma alpha.
                    * Bake all static parts of the hero in a single rgb bitmap?
                        * Put the ascii table and all other stuff in a single texture (atlas).
                        * No valid reasons if all is one dip.
                    * Allocate all procedural sprites in the atlas?
                    * Generate actual pixels directly in the atlas?
                Implement hierarchy of transform and use it to setup the character visuals.
            Draw a marker showing the direction.
        Background/Terrain to show movement (no obstacles).
            Noise map asset.
            Implement camera zoom in/out.
            Background made with nice noise using tiles.
            Backround moves.
        Use keys to move the hero.
            Hero always locked at center of screen.
        Sound for steps.
